This is step by step instruciton on how to count reads per gene per sample

featureCounts version: 2.0.6

1. Preparation
    1.1 Prepare appropriate project tree:
     My tree is in /data/users/apiatkowska/RNAseq/   directory:

        Step_4_count_reads/
            reads_per_gene_per_sample/
            logs/

    1.2 Unzipp GFT and FASTA files if you havent done it yet:

    gunzip -k /data/users/apiatkowska/RNAseq/Step_3_map_reads/reference_genome_and_annotations/Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz
    -k keeps the original zipped file instead of deleting it

    gunzip -k /data/users/apiatkowska/RNAseq/Step_3_map_reads/reference_genome_and_annotations/Mus_musculus.GRCm39.115.gtf.gz

2. Count reads per gene per sample
